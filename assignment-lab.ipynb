    "\n",
    "The notebook will only run one cell at a time, so if you press `shift-return` several times, the cells will wait for one another.  You can tell that a cell is waiting if it there's a `*` in the `[]` to the left the cell:\n",
    "\n",
    "![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll can also tell _where_ the notebook is executing by looking at the table of contents on the left.  The section with the currently-executing cell will be red:\n",
    "\n",
    "![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### What to Do Jupyter Notebook It Gets Stuck\n",
    "\n",
    "First, check if it's actually stuck: Some of the cells take a while, but they will usually provide some visual sign of progress.  If _nothing_ is happening for more than 10 seconds, it's probably stuck.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get it unstuck, you stop execution of the current cell with the \"interrupt button\":\n",
    "\n",
    "![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also restart the underlying python instance (i.e., the confusingly-named \"kernel\" which is not the same thing as the operating system kernel) with the restart button:\n",
    "\n",
    "![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you do this, all the variables defined by earlier cells are gone, so you may get some errors.  You may need to re-run the cells in the current section to get things to work again.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also try reloading the web page.  That will leave Python kernel intact, but it can help with some problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Errors and Non-Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  If you get something like `failed: no such file or directory`, please make sure you executed all cells before the current one.\n",
    "2.  Sometimes `cse142 run` will just sit there and seemingly do nothing.  Weirdly, interrupting the kernel (button above) and restart the kernel seems to jolt it awake and cause it to continue.\n",
    "3. If you get errors similar to `NameError: name 'render_csv' is not defined` or something similar, please re-execute the very beginning cell of this document.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Embedded Code\n",
    "\n",
    "The code embedded in the assignment falls into two categories:\n",

    "1.  Code you need to edit and understand.\n",
    "2.  Code that you do not need to edit or understand -- it's just there to display something for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "For code in the first category, the assignment will make it clear that you need to study, modify, and/or run the code.  If we don't explicitly ask you to do something, you don't need to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the code in the second category is for drawing graphs.  You can just run it with shift-return to the see the results.  If you are curious, it's mostly written with `Pandas` and `matplotlib`. The code is all in `notebook.py`.   These cells should be un-editable.  However, if you want to experiment with them, you can copy _the contents_ of the cell into a new cell and do whatever you want (If you copy the cell, the copy will also be uneditable).\n",

    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-danger\">\n",

    "### Answering Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this document, you'll see some questions (like the one below).  You can double click on them to edit them and fill in your answer.  Try not to mess up the formatting (so it's easy for us to grade), but at least make sure your answer shows up clearly.  When you are done editing, you can `shift-return` to make it pretty again.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few tips, pointers, and caveats for answering questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The answers are all in [github-flavored markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) with some html sprinkled in.  Leave the html alone.\n",
    "2. Many answers require you to fill in a table, and many of the `|` characters will be missing.  You'll need to add them back.\n",
    "3. The HTML needs to start at the beginning of a line.  If there are spaces before a tag, it won't render properly.  If you accidentally add white space at the beginning of a line with an html tag on it, you'll need to fix it.\n",
    "4. Text answers also need to start at the beginning of a line, otherwise they will be rendered as code.\n",
    "5. Press `shift-return` or `option-return` to render the cell and make sure it looks good.\n",
    "6. There needs to be a blank line between html tags and markdown.  Otherwise, the markdown formatting will not appear correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll notice that there are three kinds of questions: \"Correctness\", \"Completeness\", and \"Optional\".  You need to provide an answer to the \"Completeness\" questions, but you won't be graded on its correctness.  You'll need to answer \"Correctness\" questions correctly to get credit.  The \"Optional\" questions are optional.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Grading\n",
    "\n",
    "### CSE142\n",
    "If you are taking CSE142, you will need to submit the CSE142&CSE142L questions before each CSE142 assignment deadline. These questions will be graded based on correctness.\n",
    "\n",
    "### CSE142L\n",
    "Your grade for this lab report will be based on your completion and submission of this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "### Submissions\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions for submitting the assignment/lab are at the end of the assignment/lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "No late work or extensions will be allowed.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "ILP and MLP exist within a single core, and the degree of parallelism is limited by the number of instructions the CPU can issue per cycle. To get more parallelism, we need to use more CPUs, and for that we'll need to create threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "A thread is a flow of control through your program that runs on a processor. Every program has at least one thread, and by creating multiple threads you can spread the work of your program across many cores, hopefully improving it's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Making programs fast via multi-threading is an extremely deep and complex area. We could easily spend an entire quarter studying techniques for creating, managing, and using threads, and most universities (including UCR) offer several courses on this topic (Start with Operating Systems and then take the graduate Parallel Computation course). Indeed, some people have devoted their entire careers to the topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "All this effort is for good reason: the amount of ILP and MLP that individual cores can utilize has been roughly constant over last decade and shows no signs of improving much. Making matters worse, clock speeds are growing very slowly. That means that adding cores is the main way that computer are getting faster, but that only works if we can use threads effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, it's week 8, and we don't have time for all of that. Instead, we are going to take a whirlwind tour of how you can create threads, how to make them communicate with one another, why the underlying hardware can make that hard and/or slow, and what you can do about it.\n",

    "\n",
    "You might notice that it also says `CPU(s): 8`.  This would be better phrased as \"logical cores\".  It's twice the number of actual (physical) cores because each of the cores can run two threads at once via Hyperthreading.  These cores are numbered 0-11.\n",

    "What's going on?  It would seem that our intuitive understanding of how our multi-threaded program should execute does not match what actually happens when it really executes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This source of this mismatch is something called the processor's _consistency model_.   The consistency model determines how processors \"see\" memory operations performed by other processors.  In particular, it  determines in what order stores _appear_ to occur.  Different instruction sets come with different consistency models: x86 has one, ARM has one, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consistency models are easily the most complicated aspect of modern Instruction Set Architectures, and their details are pretty far beyond the scope of this course. However, they are crucial for making multithreaded programs work, so we will cover a few basic points.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic problem with the code above is that the x86 consistency model allows the stores that `T0` performs to _appear_ , from `T1`'s perspective, to happen in a different order than `T0` executed them in.  In the code above, `T1` can load from `flag` and find that it's equal to 0 _and then_ read from `other_value` and find it equal to one.\n",
    "\n",
    "x86 provides some special instructions that prevent this reordering.  They are called 'fences' because they keep memory operations from moving around.  It's possible to use them directly, but that's a subject for another class.  Instead, we'll use _locks_, which are a cleaner way of coordinating threads.\n",

    "If a thread calls `lock()` on a mutex that is not currently locked, the thread \"holds\" the lock and starts executing a region of code called a \"critical section\".  At the end of the critical section, it calls `unlock()` to release the lock.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a thread, `T`, calls `lock()` on a mutex that _is_ currently locked, it will wait until the thread that holds it calls `unlock()`.  Then, `T` gets the lock and can proceed.\n",

    "There are two main things to take away from this data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Just taking and releasing locks is expensive -- even if there's only one thread.  This overhead comes mostly from increased instruction count.  In addition, fences are expensive: could take hundreds of cycles on our machine.\n",
    "2.  When there is more than one thread competing for the lock, things get even worse.  This overhead comes from increase cache misses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these are noteworthy.  The extra instructions in the locks are an example of the overhead involved in improving performance.  We saw this before with loop tiling:  Splitting and renesting loops can improve performance but it also increases instruction count, so some of the improved performance goes to paying for that overhead.  It the same thing here:  Taking and releasing a lock is code we didn't have to run before and that doesn't contribute to the useful work our program is doing.  There is no free lunch.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cache misses are a bigger problem and, interestingly, they are due to kind of cache miss we have not seen before in this class.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cache Coherence and the 4th C\n",
    "\n",
    "In assignment 2 we've seen the Capacity, Conflict, and Compulsory misses, but there is a 4th kind of miss that only occurs in multi-processing systems:  Coherence Misses.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you learned in CSE142, cache coherence is how the processor keeps multiple caches synchronized, so that the processors all see the same value for a given address.\n",
    "\n",
    "To refresh your memory, the key point of coherence are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Coherence operates on cache lines, like all things in the memory hierarchy.\n",
    "2.  Multiple processors can have a copy of the a cache line in their cache if they are _only_ reading from it.\n",
    "3.  Only a single processor may have a copy of the cache line if it is writing to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enforcing #2 and #3 is expensive:  When a processor wants to update a cache line, it has to tell all the processors that have a copy of it to _invalidate_ their copy.  This means removing it from the cache.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When a memory access would have been a hit, but it is a miss because the cache was invalidated, we call that a _coherence miss_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Satisfying cache misses is multiprocessors is also more complicated due to coherence:  If a load misses in the cache it has to check the other caches to see if they have a copy.  If they do, then that copy is more up-to-date than what is in main memory, so that is where the cache line needs to be loaded from.  This is called a _cache-to-cache_ transfer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The invalidations and cache-to-cache transfers are implemented by sending message between the caches over an on-chip network. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sending messages across such a network can be pretty expensive and take quite a long time.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "### Coherence Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple program to measure the cost of communicating between cores.  We are going to run two threads either on the same core or on two different cores.  The only trick is that we control which thread runs where.  You can look at `threads.hpp` to see how `bind_to_core()` works.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing to keep in mind:  When the two threads are running on the same core, they will have to take turns, so that single core will be doing twice as much work than each core in the two-core case.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in an ideal world, the two-core case would be twice as fast as the one-core case.\n"

    "\n",
    "So far, in this class we've talked about Amdahl's Law as it applies optimizations:  The more widely applicable an optimization, the larger it's benefit.  Originally, however, Amdahl's Law was just about parallel computation.  In particular, if we have $p$ processors, Amdahl's Law bounds the maximum speedup, $S$, we can achieve:\n",
    "$$S \\leq \\frac{1}{x/p + (1-x)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $x$ is the fraction of the program that can parallelized across all $p$ processors.  For the histogram example, $x = 1$, so $S \\leq p$, and our implementation achieved this upper bound.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, however, $x < 1$, so $S < p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see this, let's parallelize merge sort.  The implementation below divides the array in half and recursively calls merge sort on each sub array.  To parallelize it, we will spawn a thread to sort each sub-array.  As the sub arrays get smaller and smaller, two things will happen:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  We will spawn an enormous number of threads.\n",
    "2.  Each of them will do very little work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neither of these is good, so we'll use `threshold` to control the minimum size for which we will spawn a thread.  If the sub-array is smaller than `threshold`, we'll just do all the work in the current thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that if the array is of size `threshold` $ \\times 2^k$, we'll use a maximum of $2^k$ threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll notice that there are no locks.  This is because there's not actually any sharing:  Only one thread is ever working on any one part of the array at a time.  (The attentive reader will recall that I said that sharing is necessary to coordinate threads.  Here, the sharing and coordination happen before the threads are created and after we `join()` them). "

The loop needs to very regular (e.g., constant stride and no branches), and there's no guarantee that the compiler will be able to vectorize it.  Indeed, `omp simd` doesn't speedup our histogram code, so we'll look at a simpler example.\n",
